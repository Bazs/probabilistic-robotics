Solutions for some problems in the book Probabilistic Robotics (Thrun, S. and Burgard, W. and Fox, D. and Arkin, R.C. 2005 MIT Press), mostly for self-educational purposes.

The repository is sectioned based on languages. The Java and C++ sections contain some solutions for problems in the earlier chapters.
The python section is home to a simple [GraphSLAM example implementation](https://github.com/Bazs/probabilistic-robotics/tree/master/ProbabilisticRoboticsPython/GraphSLAM) - work in progress.
